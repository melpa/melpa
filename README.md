# MELPA

Repository of code for *MELPA* or *Milkypostman's ELPA* or *Milkypostman's Experimental Lisp Package Repository* if you're not into the whole brevity thing.

MELPA is rebuilt at least once a day and on demand when changes are made to the MELPA repository.  All packages are built using the `package-build.el` package.


## Scripts

* `buildpkg` -- Create an archive of the package(s) passed as
arguments to the script. Built packages are put in the `packages/`
folder with version corresponding to the newest HEAD revision
available; given according to the `%Y%m%d` format.

* `melpa` -- All the logic for generating everything in
the repository based on the `pkglist` file.  By default this will build all packages listed in `pkglist`,
compile the `index.html` file for the [melpa] website front page, and
sync with the site.

    The following arguments are accepted,

    clear
    :   clean out the `packages/` directory

    build
    :   build all packages in `pkglist`

    index
    :   build the `index.html` file

    validate
    :   naively validate that the correct number of packages were built.

## Code

The `package-build.el` file contains all the heavy lifting. The
scripts above call the `package-build-archive` function from the
command-line to actually build the package(s).

Use `(package-build-all)` to build all melpa packages.

Alternatively you can
load this file from within Emacs and issues commands from there.

The `package-build.el` automatically generates any required
information for the package. For multi-file packages this include
generating the file `<NAME>-pkg.el` which contains *description*,
*version*, and *requires* information determined by searching
`<NAME>-pkg.el`, `<NAME>.el`, and `<NAME>-pkg.el.in` if they exist in
the repository.


## Contributing New Packages

Packages are specified in the `pkglist` file alphabetically for convenience and because we need some rules.  You can contribute a new package by adding a new entry to `pkglist` using the following form, 

    (name :url "<repo url>" 
     :fetcher [git|svn|darcs|wiki] 
     [:files ("<file1>", ...)])
     
`name`
:   a lisp symbol that has the same name as the package being specified.  

`:url`
:   specifies the URL of the version control repository. *not required for the `wiki` fetcher*

`:fetcher`
:   specifies the type of repository that `:url` points to.  Right now package-build supports [git][git], [subversion (svn)][svn], [darcs][darcs], and [Emacs Wiki (wiki)][emacswiki] as possible mechanisms for checking out the repository.  With the exception of the Emacs Wiki fetcher, package-build uses the corresponding application to update files before building the package.  The Emacs Wiki fetcher gets the latest version of the package from `http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/<NAME>.el` where `NAME` is the package name.  Note that the `:url` property is not needed for the `wiki` engine unless the name of the package file on the EmacsWiki differs from the package name being built.

`:files`
:   optional property specifying the explicit files used to build the package.  Automatically populated by matching all `.el` files in the root of the repository.  This is necessary when there are multiple `.el` files in the repository but the package should only be built from a subset.

### Single File Repository

[ido-ubiquitous](https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/ido-ubiquitous) is a repository that contains two files:
    * `README.md`
    * `ido-ubiquitous.el`
    
Since there is only one `.el` file, this package only needs the `:url` and `:fetcher` specified,

    (ido-ubiquitous
     :url "https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/ido-ubiquitous.git"
     :fetcher git)
    

### Multiple Packages in one Repository
    
The
[emacs-starter-kit](https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit)
contains the *starter-kit* package along with extra packages in the
`modules` directory; *starter-kit-bindings*, *starter-kit-lisp*, etc.

    (starter-kit
     :url "https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit.git"
     :fetcher git)
    (starter-kit-bindings
     :url "https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit.git"
     :fetcher git
     :files ("modules/starter-kit-bindings.el"))
   
Notice that `:files` is not specified for `starter-kit` since package-build will automatically add all `.el` files in the root directory of the repository.  The `starter-kit-bindings` repository is contained in the `modules/` subdirectory and thus needs the packages files specified explicitly.


### Submitting the Package

You should first fork the MELPA repository, add your new entry to `pkglist`, and confirm your new package builds properly by running `buildpkg <NAME>`.  You can install the package that you built by running the interactive command `package-install-file` in Emacs, and specifying the newly built package which should be in the `packages/` subdirectory under the melpa directory.

After verifying the entry works properly please open a pull request on Github.



## Configuration


Packages end up in the `packages/` directory by default.
This can be configured using the `package-build-archive-dir` variable.

Repositories are checked out to the `working/` directory by default.
This can be configured using the `package-build-working-dir` variable.
