# MELPA Config Files

This directory contains config files for applications needed to
maintain the MELPA infrastructure.

Currently this directory contains local config files for *nginx* and
*logrotate* which are run by the user processes.

The `etc` directory contains system-level configs required to
configure the main `runit` process to run user services as well as the
main *nginx* proxy.
