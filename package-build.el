;;; Commentary:

;; This file allows a curator to publish an archive of Emacs packages.

;; The archive is generated from an index, which contains a list of
;; projects and repositories from which to get them.  The term
;; "package" here is used to mean a specific version of a project that
;; is prepared for download and installation.

;;; Code:

;; Since this library is not meant to be loaded by users
;; at runtime, use of cl functions should not be a problem.
