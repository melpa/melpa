* Publish an archive of Emacs packages

~package-build~ allows a curator to publish an archive of Emacs
packages.  [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]] uses ~package-build~ and a few downstream projects are
listed [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa/wiki/Downstream-Projects][here]].

The archive is generated from a set of recipes, which describe elisp
projects and repositories from which to get them.  The term "package"
here is used to mean a specific version of a project that is prepared
for download and installation.  The recipe format is documented [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa#recipe-format][here]].
