;; For security reasons Melpa does not distribute any packages that
;; are maintained on the Emacswiki.  For this package we are forced to
;; make an exception because it is required by several non-emacswiki
;; packages, which in turn are required by Spacemacs.
;;
;; The Emacsmirror imports this package like it mirrors any other
;; package that is maintained on the Emacswiki, by extracting the
;; history of the respective library and putting the result in the
;; `master' branch of the respective repository on the Emacsmirror;
;; in this case https://github.com/emacsmirror/highlight.
;;
;; Melpa then mirrors the `melpa' branch of that repository.  Unlike
;; the `master' branch, the `melpa' branch isn't semi-automatically
;; updated.  Instead some user has to open a pull-request asking me to
;; "merge master into melpa".  I'll then review the changes and merge.
;; I expect this will only happen if there are breaking changes.
