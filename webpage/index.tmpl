% MELPA

*MELPA* or *Milkypostman's ELPA* or *Milkypostman's Experimental Lisp Package Repository* if you're not into the whole brevity thing.

>Xg a repository for development versions of Emacs packages (hot from the repo).

## Installing

To add the repository put this before the call to `package-initialize`
in your `init.el` file.

    (add-to-list 'package-archives
                 '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)


## Known Issues

Due to the way the HTTP routing works on my provider, the HTTP/1.1
connection will time out for long package installs -- where the
package is large and takes a while to compile -- like *magit* or *evil*.

    (setq url-http-attempt-keepalives nil)

This makes things a tad more slow but means that the install goes OK.


## Development

[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa](https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa)

Contributions are welcome.  Currently, the builder only supports
packages using git, subversion, mercurial, and darcs.  This covers
most of the packages that I am interested in.
